# Advent of Code 2025
December has started, I forgot, but let's go! The initial idea was to learn Rust by doing but now I think that will take too much time. Instead, It'll be python, hacky and fast. 

## Day 1: Secret Entrance
Day one and mistake one: open the big input file and do not assume your integers lie in the range [0,99].


## Day 2: Gift Shop
OK I completely overenginered the first part and then wrote a reasonable 15 lines of code to solve both parts instead. A little bit bruteforce-ing all possible invalid IDs and then checking if they appear in one of the ranges but that's, on the other hand, fast enough to work and easy to grasp.


## Day 3: Lobby
Actually easier than both day 1 and 2.

## Day 4: Printing Department
First graph problem on day four is nice. It's also easy to solve with networkx!

## Day 5: Cafeteria
I "merged" the given ranges to check containment and length of the ranges. I'm pretty sure that I've written the merging-code for AOC some earlier year...
